# CS 3503 Assignment 1 - Number Base Conversion

## Author
Haziel Varela

## Description
My implementation of Owl Tech's number base conversion utility.

## Build Instructions
'''bash
gcc -o convert convert.c main.c
./convert
'''

## Test Results
Summary: 88/100 tests passed

## Notes
Interesting to learn how pointers work. Challenging for my first C program. Learned a lot about converting bases from having to implement it into code. Could not figure out how to get some tests to pass or how to print the 3 lines of print_tables onto the output.txt file.
